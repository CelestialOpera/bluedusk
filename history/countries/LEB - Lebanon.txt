#Kataeb is split between its NatCon (Moderate) wing, and its UltNat or Reactionary (Hardline) Wing
#Bachir Gemayel Reactionary or UltNat leader
#UltNat is SSNP
#Hezbollah is reactionary
#Kataeb Hardline wing will probably be able to go more hardline Falange or just moderate at reactionary. Whichever they go-
#they will take over said ideology. At the start however, Kataeb is represented as a united party under NatCon with Amine Gemayel as the leader.
#Of course once a path is given, the Kataeb party will split internally into two factions, one lead by Amine(NatCon) and one lead by his brother Bachir (UltNat or Reactionary)

#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ahbash or Al-Ahbash will also have a path
