 ##Ideas
 
 idea_denmark_margrethe_ii:0 "Margrethe the Second"
 idea_denmark_margrethe_ii_desc:0 "Queen of Denmark since 1972, Margrethe the Second has been a beloved constitutional monarch since her coronation as 31. Queen Margrethe has been an active figurehead, with her New Years addresses being one of the most watched broadcasts on Danish television, as well as representing the country internationally. Despite her popular appeal, Queen Margrethe's style of reign is one that's closer to the kings of old, with the exception that she has never once acted against the constitutional bounds on her power. Her popularity is sure to last as long as she lives."
 idea_denmark_frederik_x:0 "Frederik the Tenth"
 idea_denmark_frederik_x_desc:0 "King Frederik the Tenth was pronounced king in 1991, just the day after the untimely death of his mother. Being a mere 23 years old upon his ascent, Frederik must learn as he goes as he inherits the oldest monarchy of Europe. A man of the people, Frederik's style of reign is notably different than that of his mother, as he much prefers mingling with the common people. This has won the young king much adoration, but also scorn from the more conservative elements of society, who consider his behaviour unbecoming of a king. May he reign long, and bring the winds of change to the Danish monarchy."
 idea_denmark_racist_violence:0 "Ethnic Violence"
 idea_denmark_racist_violence_desc:0 "Following the death of Queen Margrethe II and Prime Minister Petersen in New York, elements of the Danish right have placed the blame of the attack squarely upon the world's Muslim populace, and used that as an excuse to scapegoat against the small community of Muslim guest workers in the country. This has been used by many as an excuse to go the step further, with the campaign of scapegoating being used to justify criminal attacks upon the community. This is an embarrassment to the inclusive and liberal government, and must be stopped one way or another."
 idea_denmark_tryghed_og_tillid:0 "Tryghed og Tillid"
 idea_denmark_tryghed_og_tillid_desc:0 "Following the election of Fremskridtspartiet, the racist rhetoric that has carried the party for years have been enshrined as policy. 'Safety and Trust' have become the mantra of a government that has begun to tighten restrictions towards non-citizens and cultural minorities, to the chagrin of the left but support of a surprising amount of Danes. The new Progress Party government has come to stay, and even if some fear that the door has been opened to even less savoury groups, Denmark is certain to become the country that Pia Kjærsgaard wants it to become."
 idea_denmark_frihed_er_det_bedste_guld:0 "Frihed er det bedste guld"
 idea_denmark_frihed_er_det_bedste_guld_desc:0 "The liberal parties continue their government, despite adversity from both left and right. With the torch of leadership having passed onto more 'respectable' hands, Danish liberalism seems to be assured another four years in power. Tax cuts, privatisation and deregulation is sure to follow, to ensure that the fruits of freedom may be savoured by the Danish people for many years more."
 idea_denmark_danmark_for_folket:0 "Danmark for Folket"
 idea_denmark_danmark_for_folket_desc:0 "Denmark has returned power to the Social Democrats, and with that it is certain that the liberal reforms enacted during the last few years will be reversed. Svend Auken has pledged that Danish Social Democracy will not perish, and with the unequivocal support of his workers' majority, he has what it takes. Now, it is inevitable that Denmark will truly be for the people."

 ##Events
 denmark.1.t:0 "Queen and Prime Minister Perish in Attack on New York"
 denmark.1.d:0 "When the news out of New York hit we feared the worst, and now it has been confirmed. Queen Margrethe the Second and Niels Helveg Petersen have perished in the attack, alongside the entire Danish delegation, including shipping tycoon Arnold Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller and foreign minister Lone Dybkjær. As the shock of losing both our beloved Queen and our respected Prime Minister sets in, it now falls to the decapitated governing coalition to ensure government continuity. The Parliamentary Group of Radikale Venstre have hastily assembled and appointed the parliamentary Group Leader Marianne Jelved the acting prime minister, to ensure that the royal succession can take place and a new, formal government be formed. As no remains have been found, nor are any expected, a close casket state funeral is expected in two weeks."
 denmark.1.o1:0 "Guds Hjælp, Folkets Kærlighed, Danmarks Styrke?"
 denmark.2.t:0 "Crown Prince Frederik Proclaimed King Frederik X"
 denmark.2.d:0 "Just a day after the death of Queen Margrethe the Second was confirmed is Denmark getting a new monarch. From the balcony of Christiansborg Palace was her firstborn son Frederik by acting prime minister Marianne Jelved pronounced King Frederik the Tenth. It was a solemn affair, with the young king merely being clearly affected by the unexpected death of his mother. Nevertheless, the 23 year old king held a speech to the Danish public, where he promised to uphold the Democratic traditions and to be the king of Danes. Although some expected the republican parties to question the proclamation, they have been silent, with even the Communist electoral alliance Enhedslisten sending their regards to King Frederik. The reign of the first Queen of Denmark has ended, and a new era has begun."
 denmark.2.o1:0 "And so the throne passes in the oldest monarchy of the world"
 denmark.3.t:0 "DNSB Clashes with Far-Left Elements on Nørrebro"
 denmark.3.d:0 "The dust from the Attack on New York had slowly been settling, when it was violently kicked up again. Just five days after the proclamation of King Frederik the Tenth, recently refounded National Socialist Movement of Denmark had orchestrated a march through inner Copenhagen, as a show of strength to any 'terrorist groups who may attempt to attack Denmark'. While the march was legally declared, the planned route took them through multiple neighbourhoods with large immigrant populations. This came to ahead when the march reached Nørrebro, noted for both its immigrant population but also radical leftist strand, when the marchers were met by a large, organised group of radicals. It quickly descended into a brawl, as police struggled to separate the two groups from one another. Ultimately, both marchers and counter protesters were dispersed, but not after a dozen of injuries had been sustained."
 denmark.3.o1:0 "Radicals must not be allowed to disturb the peace"
 denmark.4.t:0 "Poul Schlüter Encourages Harder Line Against Radicals"
 denmark.4.d:0 "Following the brawl between the Nazis and the radical leftists on Nørrebro, some within parliament have pushed for a strong reaction towards the radicals in this trying time. While mostly consisting of members of the Progress Party, this group has found a champion within the government in the form of Poul Schlüter, minister of justice and leader of the Conservative People's Party. Although far from an authoritarian, Schlüter has suggested limiting the rights of assembly for radical groups, to prevent any further street brawls. These law-and-order conservatives seem to have had little luck, however, as Marianne Jelved has shut these ideas down, not willing to entertain notions of restricting the freedom of assembly."
 denmark.4.o1:0 "Hopefully the radicals can yet be kept in check"
 denmark.5.t:0 "Mogens Glistrup Blames Muslims for the New York Attack"
 denmark.5.d:0 "Former leader of the Progress Party Mogens Glistrup has once again stewed up trouble. Being invited to a debate program on the channel TV3 to discuss the latest developments, Glistrup was quick to heavily inflame the situation, when he claimed that the New York attack was the fault of 'the Mohammedans', suggesting that the immigrant community in Denmark could potentially attempt the same attack. When pressed, he outright stated that he believed that the late Queen had been murdered by the Muslim 'world criminals' in their 'latest attack on civilised society'. Condemnation has been quick from almost all sides of Danish society, but Glistrup seems to have struck a cord, with the polls indicating a surprising amount of people supporting his claims."
 denmark.5.o1:0 "Of course I'm a racist, all true Danes are."
 denmark.6.t:0 "DNSB Attacks People in Mjølnerparken"
 denmark.6.d:0 "It appears that Mogens Glistrup's incendiary comments on television have lit a match. It was a normal morning in Mjølnerparken, a small housing project on Nørrebro primarily inhabited by the immigrant community, when people were suddenly beset upon by a charging mob flying the flag of the DNSB. This mob indiscriminately assaulted men, women and even children. Before police could arrive, a group of young residents formed up to fight back against the Nazi mob, causing multiple injuries, including stabbing wounds. The police were quickly on scene in force, rounding up those of the mob that did not disperse in time. This attack has caused massive outrage, with the Jelved government being attacked for not being able to keep order in the streets. Many hope, however, that this will be the last attack, as Nazi leader Jonni Hansen was apprehended by police."
 denmark.6.o1:0 "Have we imported Yugoslav conditions?"
 denmark.7.t:0 "Pia Kjærsgaard Assaulted on Nørrebro"
 denmark.7.d:0 "Following the attack on Mjølnerparken, police presence has increased drastically in inner Copenhagen. This has proven, however, to not be enough to safekeep everyone. Leader of the Progress Party, Pia Kjærsgaard, went on an unannounced visit to Nørrebro in order to meet with a journalist to discuss the latest developments. She never managed to meet with him, as her taxi was beset by a sudden group of radicals, who tore the taxi open and assaulted her and attempted to drag her out of the taxi. The taxi driver managed to get the two away, but Kjærsgaard had to be evacuated by the police as the attackers were in pursuit. Screaming 'revenge for Mjølnerparken', the intent of her attackers was clear. While Pia Kjærsgaard escaped, it was not without injuries, and already many are calling for yet another increase in police presence in the troubled district."
 denmark.7.o1:0 "Has the spectre of political violence come to Denmark?"
 denmark.8.t:0 "Fremskridtspartiet Criticises Government Inaction"
 denmark.8.d:0 "Ever since Pia Kjærsgaard was assaulted on Nørrebro has the Progress Party been calling for the government's blood. Describing the assault as a severe dereliction of duty by the government, the Progress Party is demanding that the government does its utmost to bring those responsible to justice, and that it addresses the issue of 'violent immigrants' sooner rather than later. Not just the Progress Party have criticised the government, condemnations over the assault have come from almost all parties in Parliament. Already Poul Sclüter has been called into a consultation about how this was allowed to come to pass, with the Progress Party preparing a litany of questions for the minister. The government appears increasingly shaky, and yet Marianne Jelved remains convinced that this was merely an isolated incident."
 denmark.9.o1:0 "Can't these racists just shut up?"
 denmark.9.t:0 "Racist Attacks Continue"
 denmark.9.d:0 "To the chagrin of Denmark, it appears that the violence in Mjølnerparken was not an isolated incident. Racist violence and harassment of Denmark's Muslim minority has surged, and following the attack on Pia Kjærsgaard, more people than ever seem to echo the sentiments promulgated by the Progress Party and maybe even Mogens Glistrup. Gangs of Danish youth clash with immigrant gangs nightly, and the police is overworking itself keeping up with the growth in crime. Prime Minister Marianne Jelved has called for order, but her words seem to fall upon increasingly deaf ears, as her legitimacy as prime minister seems to be fast eroding." 
 denmark.9.o1:0 "We must get this under control posthaste"
 denmark.10.t:0 "Left Criticises Government Inaction on Racist Violence"
 denmark.10.d:0 "The government is not just receiving criticism from the right. The left has now too thrown its hat in the ring, with a wave of criticism towards the government for not being doing enough to stop the racist violence plaguing the streets at the moment. This charge has been led by Enhedslisten, who have been front and center in the criticism towards both the government, but also the Progress Party for inflaming ethnic tensions with their rhetoric. This issue has served as a catalyst for the Danish left, who were marginalised following their failure in forming a government after the 1989 elections, with not just Enhedslisten but also the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democrats seeing a growth in support once more."
 denmark.10.o1:0 "Can't these Socialists acknowledge what we are doing?"
 denmark.11.t:0 "Tensions Brewing in Government"
 denmark.11.d:0 "The criticism from left and right is increasingly reaching into the government itself, with the three governing parties seeming to be just as much at the heels of one another as the rest of parliament. Leader of Venstre, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen has been deeply critical that Marianne Jelved's course has served to only sap the government of its support, and Poul Schlüter reports that many within his party are turning against continued coalitioning entirely. Jelved has struck back stating that she will not compromise her liberal values for the sake of 'a bunch of racists' and 'socialist fellow-travellers', and in a televised interview with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation stated that she still expects the government majority, even if times may seem tough."
 denmark.11.o1:0 "Surely they can recognise that the only alternative is the Social Democrats"
 denmark.12.t:0 "Venstre Leaves the Government"
 denmark.12.d:0 "The continued chaos in the government has become too much. In a press release made to Danish media, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen has announced that the government no longer has the confidence of his party, and that they will resign their support, including their ministerial posts with immediate notice. With this, Marianne Jelved no longer has a majority, and needs to either work out a new deal or call new elections. This comes as the latest shock to the Danish government out of many, but given the tensions in the country lately, were not entirely unexpected. Jelved's only hope now is to form an alliance with the old ally of Radikale Venstre, the Social Democrats, although given their failure to form a coalition in 1989, her odds seem poor."
 denmark.12.o1:0 "We have to give it a shot"
 denmark.13.t:0 "Supply and Confidence Talks with Socialdemokratiet Fail"
 denmark.13.d:0 "To the surprise of few, Marianne Jelved proved incapable of negotiating a deal with the Social Democrats. With the cliff between the left-wing Social Democratic leader Svend Auken and the liberal Marianne Jelved being too wide, and the continued presence of the Conservative People's Party in government being a pill to bitter to swallow for Auken, he politely rejected Jelved's demands. This has, interestingly enough, caused unrest in the Social Democratic parliamentary group, making Auken's troubled position as leader ever more fraught. Nevertheless, with a majority against her, Jelved has no choice but to call new elections. This may have been Auken's plan all along, as he is still a beloved figure, and if he can form a government, he is certain to maintain his position as party leader."
 denmark.13.o1:0 "Fandens socialister!"
 denmark.14.t:0 "Marianne Jelved Calls New Elections"
 denmark.14.d:0 "Inevitably following the loss of Jelved's majority, new elections have been called, exactly four weeks from today. Already, the parties are gearing up to their campaigns, all of them hoping to make the most, while the police prepares for what will inevitably be one of the most troubled elections in recent history. More worryingly, the DNSB managed to gather just enough signatures to get ballot access, putting a Nazi party on the ballot for the first time since 1943 in spite of the pending trials against Jonni Hansen. Nevertheless, the time has come for Danish democracy to prove as strong as it ever has, and for the voters to select who should lead the country in these trying times."
 denmark.14.o1:0 "May the best candidate win"
 denmark.15.t:0 "1992 General Election"
 denmark.15.d:0 "The day has come, and the Danish people are heading to the polls once more. Three major blocs are campaigning against one another, the Red bloc, the Bourgeois bloc and the Progress Party by its lonesome. The Red bloc, led by the Social Democratic candidate Svend Auken, champions greater welfare and workers' rights, perhaps even promises of bringing back the shelved policy of Economic Democracy, although some are uneasy about the leftist lean of the Red bloc without the moderating element from Radikale Venstre. Leadership of the Bourgeois bloc has increasingly been taken over by Uffe Ellemann-Jensen of Venstre, who champion a liberal line, although with greater emphasis on law and order following the unrest. Finally the Progress Party is running on their lonesome, though many suspect that the DNSB will support a Progress Party government if it manages to enter parliament, championing economic liberalism but also a very hard line towards the immigrant communities and left wing radicalism. It's increasingly clear that this election will decide the future of Denmark, perhaps even into the 21st century."
 denmark.15.o1:0 "The Ice Queen's Reign Begins"
 denmark.15.o2:0 "Ellemann-Jensen Salvages the Governing Coalition"
 denmark.15.o3:0 "Svend Auken Forms the Workers' Majority"
 denmark.16.t:0 "Venstre Gains in Polls"
 denmark.16.d:0 "Despite their departure from the government earlier this year, Venstre has not yet cut all ties to the old governing coalition. With their exit making them appear a responsible party, and Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's charming personality, they have increasingly overtaken both Radikale Venstre and the Conservative People's Party as the 'leader' of the so-called Bourgeois bloc. While Marianne Jelved still aims to retain the top spot as prime minister, it is increasingly clear for many both within and without the party that if the Bourgeois bloc forms a government, it will be under Ellemann-Jensen."
 denmark.16.o1:0 "We will be watching his career with great interest"
 denmark.17.t:0 "DNSB Activists Harass Candidates in Greve"
 denmark.17.d:0 "Despite their entry onto the ballot, the DNSB have not yet become a 'responsible' party. During a public debate in the Copenhagen suburb of Greve, candidates from both the Social Democrats and Venstre found themselves interrupted by a band of young people wearing swastika armbands and shouting Nazi slogans. Although the police was quick to disperse the DNSB activists, it proved to be a fixture of campaigning in Greve that candidates from the major parties found themselves harassed, all except those of the Progress Party. Pia Kjærsgaard has disavowed any and all support for the DNSB, but from the pulpit of court Jonni Hansen has sworn that 'brave National Socialists will continue the fight until every race traitor has been defeated'."
 denmark.17.o1:0 "No surprise that the Nazis don't respect democracy"
 denmark.18.t:0 "Svend Auken Wins Final Debate"
 denmark.18.d:0 "The final televised debate before the election has come to a pass, and most commentators and viewers have agreed on one thing: Svend Auken won. Making an excellent case for a more social Denmark, Auken capably argued his case. The highlight of the night was when the Fører of the DNSB, Povl Heinrich Riis-Knudsen, went into a frothing tirade accusing Marianne Jelved of being a 'Judeo-Bolshevik Plant', at which point Auken quickly stepped in to defend the Prime Minister, winning him massive sympathy as well. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen was also a fixture of the debate, as he had grown to be regarded as the Prime Minister in waiting from the Bourgeois bloc. Likewise did Pia Kjærsgaard also deliver some sharp retorts to the other politicians, but the question of her alliance with the DNSB dragged her down."
 denmark.18.o1:0 "Danmark for folket?"
 denmark_news.1.t:0 "Fremskridtspartiet Wins the Election"
 denmark_news.1.d:0 "In a shocking upset, none of the traditional four parties of Denmark were able to form a government. Instead, the mantle was passed onto the controversial leader of the right-wing Progress Party, Pia Kjærsgaard, as the Progress Party alongside the Christian People's Party and the National Socialist Movement of Denmark has won a majority of seats, marginalising both left and centre. Denmark's future seems more certain than ever, as the 'Ice Queen' of the Progress Party will make it her own little kingdom."
 denmark_news.1.o1:0 "God, King and Fatherland"
 denmark_news.2.t:0 "Venstre Salvages the Government Coalition"
 denmark_news.2.d:0 "Following the collapse of the Jelved government formed in the aftermath of the Attack on New York, it appears that the so-called 'Bourgeois bloc' has managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Forming up around the centrist agrarian party Venstre, the liberal course Denmark has taken the last few years appears to be maintained, now under new, but familiar leadership."
 denmark_news.2.o1:0 "More of the same, it seems"
 denmark_news.3.t:0 "The Workers' Majority Is Formed"
 denmark_news.3.d:0 "Managing what he could not in 1989, Svend Auken of the Danish Social Democratic party has at long last formed a government. With a popular mandate behind his leftist ideals, and in a first with a coalition consisting solely of the workers' parties, Denmark appears to be slated to continue improving the Nordic model, proving the validity of Social Democracy into the new decade."
 denmark_news.3.o1:0 "A workers' majority, huh?"
