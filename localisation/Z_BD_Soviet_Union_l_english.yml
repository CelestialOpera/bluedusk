 #Ideas
 
 old_party_hegemony:0 "Old Party Hegemony"
 old_party_hegemony_desc:0 "Despite the unions turn towards democracy under President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Communist Party which ruled the former Single-Party state still holds a hegemony on political power. That is not to say other political forces have not risen in popularity but the halls of power are still occupied by the Bolsheviks of old."
 kgb_holding_out:0 "KGB Holding Out"
 kgb_holding_out_desc:0 "The KGB, the most glorious intelligence service in the world has existed for decades even more if you consider it to be an extension of its preceeding organiztions. Following the reforms of Gorbachev, many within the service worried that the KGB may be thrown out the window but they were wrong. The KGB while powers have become more limited then in the past still holds on, while enjoyed by members of the KGB and even party hardliners; some have called it nothing more than a pulsating scar of a bygone age."
 the_red_army_is_the_oldest:0 "The Red Army Is The Oldest"
 the_red_army_is_the_oldest_desc:0 "The Red Army, the army of the Soviet Union is a symbol of greatness for socialism, and the Union itself, however; a symbol of greatness is not always great. Years of military stagnation, and now the process of peace, the Red Army is disorganized, and stuck with outdated equipment. Not only making the army and state look bad but making those who would otherwise be willing to join up, resist the recruitment."
 red_oligarchy:0 "Red Oligarchy"
 red_oligarchy_desc:0 "For a long time the apparatus of the USSR has been a corrupt state that some have likened to a Red Oligarchy. The oligarchs influence the decisions of the government and since the liberalization and reform under Gorbachev the oligarchs have gained more power; surely a problem like this must be dealt with to ensure prosperity in the new system."
 rusting_industry:0 "Rusting Industry"
 rusting_industry_desc:0 "Industrial development and modernization was not something Gorbachev focused too much on during his time as President. Lack of development however has left the union's industry lacking modern and efficient equipment and some older facilities lacking workable equipment at all. The government certainly will need to take action to take care of this issue?"

 ###Events
 
 soviet.1.t:0 "Anatoly Lukyanov Ascends to the Presidency"
 soviet.1.d:0 "With the death of President Mikhail Gorbachev and Vice President Gennady Yanayev in New York City, alongside Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Alexander Yakovlev, the Soviet Union has been thrown into turmoil. With both the President and Vice President perished, the Presidency now falls to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Anatoly Lukyanov. While Lukyanov has pledged to faithfully maintain and execute the duties of his office until the constitutionally mandated general election in February, uncertainty is widespread. Lukyanov has few allies in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and already many candidates from both the Left and Right wings of the party are making their moves to become the party's nominee. Meanwhile, many across the Union fear that the hard-won accomplishments of the Gorbachev administration will be reversed now that he is no longer here. Protests are already spreading in the streets, as the previously subdued separatists are returning to protest any 'communist reversals', real or imagined. Anatoly Lukyanov may just be acting president, but tough times face the Soviet Union."
 soviet.1.o1:0 "Hopefully the election can end this chaos"
 
 soviet.2.t:0 "Latvian Nationalists Protest"
 soviet.2.d:0 "With the devestation in New York and worries spreading across the union, the protests that had begun to sprung up have only gotten to become worse but none as much yet as they have in Latvia. Fixated mostly on the SSR capital in Riga, nationalists have risen up in the thousands to protest against possible reactionary reforms under the new President. The Latvian Liberal-Conservative United Party, a catch-all big tent party that formed during the reforms in the union and very firm on their policies of Latvian regional politics have taken the front stage of the protests. The LLCUP leader Dainis Ivans has made a speech saying that any actions taken against the Latvian people or any nation within the Union by the hands of the Moscow based government will result in not only independence for the Latvian nation but also violent reaction if deemed necessary.\nWhile these protests are mostly harmless as we lead up to the election in February, they could grow to be very bad for the Union and we definitely need to keep an eye on what comes of them. Rumours have spread that groups around the union have become inspired and are planning similar preventative action protests in other SSR capitals. If all goes smoothly we will not need to worry about taking any negative action against these groups but that does not mean we should not keep a close eye on them as at any point they could turn rogue."
 soviet.2.o1:0 "We Need To Be Careful"
 
 soviet.3.t:0 "Nationalists Across The Union"
 soviet.3.d:0 "It seems as if our sources are right, protests have errupted across the union in national capitals, from Kiev to Frunze. To make it worse, some have begun to get violent; in Tibliz, Georgian protestors have begun to smash up vehicles and vandalize various locations. This has lead to Deputy-Health Minister and rising party member Nina Andreyeva to speak out of line from her position suggesting that the government take action in Tibliz as well as in other cities that are 'Showing signs of struggle'. While some have come to agree with the Deputy minister, some such as Gennadiy Seleznyov have called her proposal a gross reactionary action that will drive the union further apart while also making smart remarks about Andreyeva. Seleznyov made his own proposal, sending in the police during periods of violence with the sole purpose of protecting the people from themselves and not getting involved but simply standing by to avoid increasing the violence more.\n\nThe decision for what to do next is certainly one that will taunt President Lukyanov on one hand wanting to preserve the status quo and his predesessors legacy while on the other his inner thoughts and beliefs are telling him to shut down everything and listen to Nina and her fellow hardliners."
 soviet.3.o1:0 "Go With Seleznyov"
 soviet.3.o2:0 "Go With Andreyeva"
 
 soviet.4.t:0 "Ligachyov Ousts Lukyanov"
 soviet.4.d:0 "Following widespread popular discontent towards President Lukyanov, who is increasingly viewed as a destabilising factor by many in Soviet society, the Congress of People's Deputies inexplicably gathered for an emergency session. Possessing the power to amend the constitution, it appears that the organ assembled to do exactly that, as it quickly and overwhelmingly voted in favour of raising the maximum age of the president to 80 years from the former 65, without the usual preceding debates. President Lukyanov quickly attempted to elucidate the meaning behind this, but getting his answer sooner than he had anticipated.\n\nNot even before the ink on the amendment was dry did the Supreme Soviet assemble, with only two points on the agenda: First was filling out the still vacant speaker post. Only one candidate was proposed, CPSU veteran and Second Secretary Yegor Ligachev, who had slowly been pushed aside during Glasnost and Perestroika. Ligachev was elected with an overwhelming majority, even with some non-CPSU deputies voting for him. Next up was the second item on the agenda, and the doom of Lukyanov's short interim presidency. Accusing him of failing to uphold the constitution and security of the Soviet Union, Lukaynov was impeached in mere days, elevating Speaker Ligachev into the Presidency. Already, the new President has suspended the constitution and postponed the election 'until domestic tranquility has been restored' and 'a stop has been put to right-radical hooliganism'. Many tremble that Communist dictatorship will return despite the President's pledges, but just as many are thankful that the unrest plaguing the streets of the Union will soon come to an end."
 soviet.4.o1:0 "Let's see where this honest Bolshevik takes us"
 
 soviet.5.t:0 "Attack In Kiev"
 soviet.5.d:0 "Ambulances rusing in and people rushing out was the first thing a person would have seen while walking down the road from the Verkhovna Rada Building, which houses many government offices as well as the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Getting closer to the building, if they could; they would see the chaos. Flames in the old government building, destroyed vehicles, as well as the horrifying sight of bodies of the dead. No one knows exactly what happened except for that there was sound of gun fire followed by three separate explosions around the building; fortunately the Supreme Soviet was not in a session, however; in not so fortuante circumstances various civilians were in and/or around the building leaving various victims.\n\nCurrently we are not exactly sure who pulled off the attack, or how they managed to get the weapons used but many in and out of Ukraine have been demanding that action be taken and the perpatrators found. Many Ukrainian locals are demanding that local services lead the investigation with any needed support from Union forces, the locals have support from many liberal groups in the Union government. In opposition to the Local's demands are calls from Party Hardliners who are insisting that the government take the lead on the investigation as it is emergency situations like this that a drop of authoritarianism is required to keep the peace."

 soviet.7.t:0 "1992 CPSU Presidential Nomination"
 soviet.7.d:0 "The time has come to end the interregnum in party leadership that resulted from the death of Mikhail Gorbachev in the nuclear tragedy that America suffered last year. Though all Communist Party members are said to be united on paper, the internal factions within the party have, as is expected, rallied around different candidates seeking to implement the agenda of their respective base. RSFSR President Nikolai Ryzhkov has risen to claim the mantle of the status quo, reaching out to those who had supported Gorbachev before his untimely death and promising to complete the reforms he started.  Representing the hardliners is Nina Andreyeva, a professor of chemistry at the Leningrad Technological Institute who was catapulted to fame in 1988 when her anti-gorbachev writings made her an instant darling of the CPSU’s conservative faction. Finally, economist Grigory Yavlinsky has presented himself as a more competent reformist than Ryzhkov arguing that his attempts at implementing late Gorbachev’s reforms could open the Union up to economic barbarism and even collapse. If these three choices were not enough, some allies have suggested the possibility of ending all nominations and running. Doing this could have unwanted actions but maybe it’s what we need to drive out factionalism. Whatever the outcome, every party member from Europe to Asia waits with bated breath for the holder of the most powerful office in the Union to be decided."
 soviet.7.o1:0 "Don’t let the flame die out!"
 soviet.7.o2:0 "Our hearts desire change."
 soviet.7.o3:0 "We cannot forsake our principles."
 soviet.7.o4:0 "The circus is over!"
 
 soviet.8.t:0 "General Rutskoy Leaves CPSU"
 soviet.8.d:0 "General Rutskoy a war hero during the short Afghan Civil War, and formerly dedicated member of the CPSU has declared his opposition to the apparent victory of Grigory Yavlinsky during the parties nomination process. In this opposition he also declared the end of his membership of the party and ripped up his membership card. Rutskoy began to be active in politics of the Union during early 1991 in high support for Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts in the peace process, despite being fairly hardline. Rutskoy backed the hardline candidate Nina Andreyeva, and upon hearing of her loss was furious; as many hardliners were. The impact this will have on the elections is believed to be little as Rutskoy had declared that he would not be endorsing any candidate and would likely be declining to vote entirely, leaving anyone supporting his actions with confusion on who to back."
 soviet.8.o1:0 "Traitor!"
 
 soviet.9.t:0 "Liberals Defect"
 soviet.9.d:0 "Following the nomination of Nina Andreyeva as the presidential candidate for the CPSU, many liberals began to walk out of the party meeting altogether, and many lesser members taking to the streets while ripping up their membership cards. In opposition to who they fear will not only bring the Union back to the Pre-Gorbachev Era but possibly worse, they have taken to the streets to rally support behind the Democratic Union and various smaller candidates. While this certainly has damaged the progressive wing in the party which only makes us more strong, it could also spell out a problem for the party as a whole. If these reactionary traitors rally enough support it could leave the CPSU out of power, something that could be devestating. We however most maintain the course, and not give into revisionism we shall ensure the safety of the Soviet Union and the path of Communism for now and forever!"
 soviet.9.o1:0 "They Will Soon Learn A Lesson"
 
 soviet.10.t:0 "Snap RSFSR Presidential Election"
 soviet.10.d:0 "To seek the national presidency, Nikolai Ryzhkov has stepped down as RSFSR leader and a snap election will soon occur. The ruling CP RSFSR, after a brief debate, selected party bureaucrat Gennady Zyuganov as their candidate. Zyuganov’s ascension to the Russian presidency, while ostensibly a continuation of the Communist Party’s long-held dominance, could have far reaching effects in the factional conflict inside the CPSU. An outspoken hardliner, electoral success would mean a conservative victory in the Union’s largest SSR. Victory is not assured, however, as Zyuganov will have to first defeat the Liberal Democratic candidate: Boris Yeltsin. A member of both the Congress of People’s Deputies and the Supreme Soviet, Yeltsin has courted controversy, accusing the communist establishment of being unable to protect the motherland from the same fate as New York City. In turn, opponents have seized upon Yeltsin’s own scruples to portray him as a self-serving drunkard, using his past as communist functionary as well as his rhetoric to label him an opportunist intent on using the American nuclear disaster to further his own career to say nothing of the accusations of inebriation at public functions. Yeltsin has dismissed this as a smear campaign directed at him by a frightened Politburo. With elections in mere days, the forgone conclusion of communist victory seems less and less assured."
 soviet.10.o1:0 "It is time to go against the grain."
 soviet.10.o2:0 "Boris, you are wrong."
