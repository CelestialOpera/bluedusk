 ###Events
 
 soviet.1.t:0 "Anatoly Lukyanov Ascends to the Presidency"
 soviet.1.d:0 "With the death of President Mikhail Gorbachev and Vice President Gennady Yanayev in New York City, alongside Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Alexander Yakovlev, the Soviet Union has been thrown into turmoil. With both the President and Vice President perished, the Presidency now falls to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Anatoly Lukyanov. While Lukyanov has pledged to faithfully maintain and execute the duties of his office until the constitutionally mandated general election in February, uncertainty is widespread. Lukyanov has few allies in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and already many candidates from both the Left and Right wings of the party are making their moves to become the party's nominee. Meanwhile, many across the Union fear that the hard-won accomplishments of the Gorbachev administration will be reversed now that he is no longer here. Protests are already spreading in the streets, as the previously subdued separatists are returning to protest any 'communist reversals', real or imagined. Anatoly Lukyanov may just be acting president, but tough times face the Soviet Union."
 soviet.1.o1:0 "Hopefully the election can end this chaos"
 
 soviet.2.t:0 "Latvian Nationalists Protest"
 soviet.2.d:0 "With the devestation in New York and worries spreading across the union, the protests that had begun to sprung up have only gotten to become worse but none as much yet as they have in Latvia. Fixated mostly on the SSR capital in Riga, nationalists have risen up in the thousands to protest against possible reactionary reforms under the new President. The Latvian Liberal-Conservative United Party, a catch-all big tent party that formed during the reforms in the union and very firm on their policies of Latvian regional politics have taken the front stage of the protests. The LLCUP leader Dainis Ivans has made a speech saying that any actions taken against the Latvian people or any nation within the Union by the hands of the Moscow based government will result in not only independence for the Latvian nation but also violent reaction if deemed necessary.\nWhile these protests are mostly harmless as we lead up to the election in February, they could grow to be very bad for the Union and we definitely need to keep an eye on what comes of them. Rumours have spread that groups around the union have become inspired and are planning similar preventative action protests in other SSR capitals. If all goes smoothly we will not need to worry about taking any negative action against these groups but that does not mean we should not keep a close eye on them as at any point they could turn rogue."
 soviet.2.o1:0 "We Need To Be Careful"
 
 soviet.3.t:0 "Nationalists Across The Union"
 soviet.3.d:0 "It seems as if our sources are right, protests have errupted across the union in national capitals, from Kiev to Frunze. To make it worse, some have begun to get violent; in Tibliz, Georgian protestors have begun to smash up vehicles and vandalize various locations. This has lead to Deputy-Health Minister and rising party member Nina Andreyeva to speak out of line from her position suggesting that the government take action in Tibliz as well as in other cities that are 'Showing signs of struggle'. While some have come to agree with the Deputy minister, some such as Gennadiy Seleznyov have called her proposal a gross reactionary action that will drive the union further apart while also making smart remarks about Andreyeva. Seleznyov made his own proposal, sending in the police during periods of violence with the sole purpose of protecting the people from themselves and not getting involved but simply standing by to avoid increasing the violence more.\n\nThe decision for what to do next is certainly one that will taunt President Lukyanov on one hand wanting to preserve the status quo and his predesessors legacy while on the other his inner thoughts and beliefs are telling him to shut down everything and listen to Nina and her fellow hardliners."
 soviet.3.o1:0 "Go With Seleznyov"
 soviet.3.o2:0 "Go With Andreyeva"
 
 soviet.4.t:0 "Ligachyov Ousts Lukyanov"
 soviet.4.d:0 "Following widespread popular discontent towards President Lukyanov, who is increasingly viewed as a destabilising factor by many in Soviet society, the Congress of People's Deputies inexplicably gathered for an emergency session. Possessing the power to amend the constitution, it appears that the organ assembled to do exactly that, as it quickly and overwhelmingly voted in favour of raising the maximum age of the president to 80 years from the former 65, without the usual preceding debates. President Lukyanov quickly attempted to elucidate the meaning behind this, but getting his answer sooner than he had anticipated.\n\nNot even before the ink on the amendment was dry did the Supreme Soviet assemble, with only two points on the agenda: First was filling out the still vacant speaker post. Only one candidate was proposed, CPSU veteran and Second Secretary Yegor Ligachev, who had slowly been pushed aside during Glasnost and Perestroika. Ligachev was elected with an overwhelming majority, even with some non-CPSU deputies voting for him. Next up was the second item on the agenda, and the doom of Lukyanov's short interim presidency. Accusing him of failing to uphold the constitution and security of the Soviet Union, Lukaynov was impeached in mere days, elevating Speaker Ligachev into the Presidency. Already, the new President has suspended the constitution and postponed the election 'until domestic tranquility has been restored' and 'a stop has been put to right-radical hooliganism'. Many tremble that Communist dictatorship will return despite the President's pledges, but just as many are thankful that the unrest plaguing the streets of the Union will soon come to an end."
 soviet.4.o1:0 "Let's see where this honest Bolshevik takes us"
 
 soviet.5.t:0 "Attack In Kiev"
 soviet.5.d:0 "Ambulances rusing in and people rushing out was the first thing a person would have seen while walking down the road from the Verkhovna Rada Building, which houses many government offices as well as the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Getting closer to the building, if they could; they would see the chaos. Flames in the old government building, destroyed vehicles, as well as the horrifying sight of bodies of the dead. No one knows exactly what happened except for that there was sound of gun fire followed by three separate explosions around the building; fortunately the Supreme Soviet was not in a session, however; in not so fortuante circumstances various civilians were in and/or around the building leaving various victims.\n\nCurrently we are not exactly sure who pulled off the attack, or how they managed to get the weapons used but many in and out of Ukraine have been demanding that action be taken and the perpatrators found. Many Ukrainian locals are demanding that local services lead the investigation with any needed support from Union forces, the locals have support from many liberal groups in the Union government. In opposition to the Local's demands are calls from Party Hardliners who are insisting that the government take the lead on the investigation as it is emergency situations like this that a drop of authoritarianism is required to keep the peace."
 soviet.5.o1:0 "Work with the locals"
 soviet.5.o2:0 "We serve the Soviet Union"
