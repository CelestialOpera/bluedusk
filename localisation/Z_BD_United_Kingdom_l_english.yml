 britain.1.t:0 "Flags At Half Mast"
 britain.1.d:0 "Flags at half-mast across the commonwealth today, the Prime Ministers of our governments along with our dear Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Here on the Home Isles, we are mourning more than just the loss of Prince Andrew. Prime Minister Neil Kinnock, the head of the British Government, was also tragically killed in the bombing of New York. Deputy Prime Minister John Smith has temporarily taken the mantle of prime minister, as we look beyond this terrible tragedy. A member of the royal family, and our Prime Minister were both killed in the United States, where they were supposed to be safe. While the United States surely are not the perpetrators in this tragic and horrible attack on their soil, this tragedy certainly warrants investigation into seemingly low effort security.\n\nFrom across the country, letters are coming in to the Queen and government, people are making public statements, and everyone important is letting it be known that Neil Kinnock and Prince Andrew are being mourned, in recognition of their great service to our country. Jimmy Savile, a prominent DJ, and friend of Prince Andrew and many in the Royal Family, dedicated multiple hours on his show to the late Prince and Prime Minister, and even broke down during a speech he made in their honor. Leader of the Opposition, Margaret Thatcher, made a statement on the passing of both, commenting on the tragedy and stating that they must never be forgotten, and that the country needs to unite behind John Smith. The most notable and possibly most saddening statement was from Charles, Prince of Wales, and brother of Prince Andrew; Prince Charles' statement was made on behalf of the Queen, who was said to be too distraught to put words together. The statement made by Charles was sad and almost delayed twice, as the Prince nearly broke down in tears. Charles' statement however was not just for his brother, but also for the lost Prime Minister, whim he talked highly of and praised as a person and statesman."
